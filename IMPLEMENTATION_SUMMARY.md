## 🔧 Critical Bug Fix

### Problem
Backend API was incorrectly reporting `total_predictions: 0` for weeks with unfinished matches (where `result: null`).

### Solution
Implemented client-side recalculation in `normalizeSummaryResponse()`:
- Counts actual predictions from `predictions` array
- Counts correct predictions by filtering `is_correct: true`
- Calculates accuracy based only on **finished matches** (where `result !== null`)

This ensures accurate statistics even when some matches haven't finished yet.

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Profile Endpoints
- `GET /api/users/profile/firebase/:firebaseUid` - Get user profile
- `GET /api/predictions/user/:userId/summary?mode=live` - Get statistics
- `GET /api/users/:userId/avatar` - Get avatar image

### Settings Endpoints
- `GET /api/users/:userId/preferences` - Get notification preferences
- `PATCH /api/users/:userId/preferences` - Update preferences
- `POST /api/users/:userId/avatar/upload` - Upload avatar (multipart)
- `DELETE /api/users/:userId` - Delete account (requires auth token)

---

## 📦 Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install expo-image-picker
```

**Already Present:**
- expo-linear-gradient
- @expo/vector-icons
- react-native Share API (built-in)

---

## 🎨 Design System

### Colors
- Purple gradient: `#554099` → `#3d2d73`
- Purple accent: `#d8b4fe`, `#9333ea`
- Green (best week): `#e7f8f2`
- Pink (worst week): `#ffeef2`
- Red (delete): `#dc2626`
- Indigo (share): `#4f46e5`

### Shadows
- Header: `shadowOpacity: 0.3, shadowRadius: 16, elevation: 8`
- Cards: `shadowOpacity: 0.1, shadowRadius: 8, elevation: 4`

---

## 🧮 KPI Calculations

### Weighted Average
```typescript
average = (total_correct / total_predictions) * 100
```
Not a simple average of weekly percentages. Weeks with more predictions weigh more heavily.

### Best Week
Sort by:
1. Highest accuracy
2. If tied: Most correct predictions
3. If still tied: Earliest week number

### Worst Week
Sort by:
1. Lowest accuracy
2. If tied: Fewest correct predictions
3. If still tied: Earliest week number

## 🔄 Navigation Flow

```
Main Tabs (Gioca, Risultati, Profilo)
    ↓
Profilo Screen (tap Settings icon)
    ↓
Impostazioni Screen
    ↓
Back button → Profilo Screen
```

Bottom navigation is hidden on Impostazioni screen.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] New user (no predictions)
- [x] User with multiple weeks of data
- [x] User with unfinished matches (week 8: 2 pending)
- [x] Best/worst week calculation
- [x] Italian formatting (comma separator)
- [x] Share functionality
- [x] Navigation between screens
- [ ] Avatar upload (valid formats)
- [ ] Avatar upload (invalid formats, large files)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Remove debug logs** - Clean up console.log statements (done)
2. **Test on physical device** - Test image picker and share on real iOS/Android
3. **Add skeleton loading** - Replace ActivityIndicator with skeleton placeholders
4. **Add animations** - Smooth screen transitions
5. **Add haptic feedback** - Vibration on toggle/button press
6. **Enable username/password edit** - When backend is ready
7. **Enable "Partite" and "Gol" notifications** - When backend implements features
8. **Add pull-to-refresh** - Refresh stats on pull down
9. **Add focus listener** - Reload Profilo when returning from Impostazioni

## 📝 Notes

### Backend Considerations
- The backend has a bug where `total_predictions: 0` is returned for weeks with unfinished matches
- Our implementation works around this by calculating from the `predictions` array
- This is a **client-side workaround** - ideally the backend should be fixed

### Italian Locale
- All percentages use comma as decimal separator: `26,7%`
- Implemented with `toLocaleString('it-IT', { maximumFractionDigits: 1 })`

### Optimistic UI
- Notification toggles update immediately (don't wait for server)
- State is automatically rolled back on error
- Provides better UX with instant feedback

## 🎉 Success Metrics

**Profilo Screen:**
- Correctly displays 3 weeks played
- Best week: 40% (week 7)
- Worst week: 20% (week 6)
- Average: 26.7% (weighted across all finished predictions)
- Week 8 shows 25% (2 out of 8 finished matches)

**Impostazioni Screen:**
- All UI components implemented
- Navigation working
- Ready for testing upload/delete features

---

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

All code follows React Native best practices:
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript with proper typing
- Memo optimization for expensive calculations
- Proper error boundaries
- Loading states
- Graceful degradation
